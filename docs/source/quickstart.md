# Quickstart

## Installation
* Set up a Sponge server as detailed [here](https://docs.spongepowered.org/master/en/server/getting-started/implementations/index.html).
* Download the latest version of the BadgeUp Sponge Client [here](https://github.com/BadgeUp/sponge-client/releases/latest).
* Place the `badgeup-sponge-client.jar` file in the `mods` directory of your server.

## Configuration
After starting the Sponge server with the BadgeUp Sponge client installed, a default configuration file will be generated (see the `config` directory).

1. Create a new BadgeUp API key with the `event:create` scope.
1. Copy the API key to the `api-key` field of the configuration file.
