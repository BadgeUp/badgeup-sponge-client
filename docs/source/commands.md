# Commands

There are 2 commands exposed to players:

`/awards`: Lists all unclaimed awards
 * Permission: `badgeup.awards.list`
 
 ---
 
`/redeem <id>`: Redeems the award with the specified ID. Not intended to be used directly by players, as they can use the UI in the `/awards` command.
 * Permission: `badgeup.awards.redeem`
